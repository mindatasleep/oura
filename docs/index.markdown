## Introduction

### Why sleep?
Sleep is paramount for performance. It's when the body and mind regenerate and strengthen. It's when the previous day's memories consolidate, and when the immune system recharges to fend off disease. However, modernity has severely distorted humanity's sleeping patterns - with factors such as artificial illumination and a limitless source for work-life unbalance.

The physical and mental impairments caused by a single night of poor sleep can significantly hinder creative, cognitive, and athletic performance. Moreover, Matthew Walker, in his recent book "Why We Sleep," points out that *"the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.‚Äù* Cue the sleep trackers.

Consumer-level sleep trackers continue to enter the market []. Understanding one's sleep patterns and its relationship to lifestyle factors can help get set up for success. Derived insights can help design lifestyle to optimize sleep, and help determine if one is primed for peak performance or if it might be better to rest and recharge.
