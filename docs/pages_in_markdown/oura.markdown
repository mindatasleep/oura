**The Oura Ring** is a wearable sleep tracker. It provides insight into nightly and long-term sleep patterns with the goal of helping a user improve sleep. Its low-key design makes for minimum-friction data input. The minimalist ring is simply worn during sleep and, in the morning, transmits the night's data in a single chunk to its companion app via bluetooth. It can also be worn throughout the day's hustle and bustle to measure the level of activity. 

Oura's derived metrics are proxy for sleep quality and restfulness. These include respiratory rate, changes in temperature, average heart rate, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). We are going to interface the Oura Cloud API to extract data and comparatively look at its relationship with lifestyle trends in a web app. Note that you'll need an [Oura Cloud](https://cloud.ouraring.com/dashboard) account to follow along.
